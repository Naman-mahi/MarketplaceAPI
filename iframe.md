### How to Use in WebView:
1. **For Static Links (Test)**: Use these links directly as URLs in your WebView to display predefined content.
   
2. **For Dynamic Links (Use)**: Replace the placeholders `{username}` and `{organization_id}` in the URLs with the actual values dynamically. For example:
   - Replace `{username}` with the userâ€™s actual username.
   - Replace `{organization_id}` with the relevant organization ID.

3. **Integration in WebView**: To load the URLs in your WebView component, you can use code similar to the following:
   ```javascript
   webview.loadUrl("https://proffid.com/employee-card/" + username);
